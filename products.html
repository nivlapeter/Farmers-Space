        <p> Our line of organic fertilizers from our farmers offer an eco-friendly management of turf and permits to
          drastically reduce the chemical component of fertilization. The special composition provides organic
          matter rich in humic acid and amino-acids essential to photosynthesis. The bacterial microflora they
          contain helps the processes of humification and mineralization, therefore the transformation of the
          undecomposed organic substance in assimilable nutrients, allows the degradation of the felt and the
          mobilization and use of all minerals accumulated in the soil with the previous chemical treat. The
          moderate but steady growth allows to drastically reduce cuttings.</p>
